TinyBoy is designed as an entry-level machine for students and newbies to learn 3D modelling technology and, ultimately, to encourage creative thinking.  Tinyboy 3D printer is ultra-portable by being small. A one-to-one student to printer ratio can be achieved in computer classrooms to maximize the exposure of student to 3D printing technology. Students can also carry the printer around beyond classrooms to engage in their learning activities. On the other hand, it is very usable for education purpose for printing figures, toys and other creations that students like.  Tinyboy is easy to build. Any student can assemble the TinyBoy by just a screw driver. We wish students can make their own machine and become pioneers to help other people. So that the use of 3D printer can be spread to their families and communities.  The process of making can transform education by inviting students to go beyond being consumers of education. They can be a maker of anything, moving from being directed to self-directed through the process."

Later he joined the Italian Pirate Party in the endeavor of designing a leaderless political party, continuously governed by a permanent electronic assembly \u2013 where decisions are taken together. At first it didn't work, but after several years of design re-iterations it now seems like the design is functional. A large-scale digital assembly or parliament is not only possible, it can also be self-governed."
